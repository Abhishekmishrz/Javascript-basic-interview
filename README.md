1. **What is JavaScript?**
   - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used for web development. It allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

2. **What are the differences between JavaScript and Java?**
   - JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for front-end web development, while Java is a general-purpose programming language used for various applications.
   - JavaScript is interpreted, whereas Java is compiled.
   - JavaScript runs in the browser, whereas Java runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.

4. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**
   - `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - `undefined` is the default value for variables that have not been initialized, or for missing properties in objects.

5. **What are closures?**
   - Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer (enclosing) function even after the outer function has finished executing.

6. **What are callback functions?**
   - Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and executed later, typically after an asynchronous operation completes.

7. **Explain the `this` keyword in JavaScript.**
   - The `this` keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. The value of `this` depends on how a function is called.

8. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**
   - The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows the execution of asynchronous code. It ensures that callbacks are executed after the main execution stack is empty.

9. **What are Promises in JavaScript?**
   - Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable manner. They represent a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved or rejected eventually.

10. **What is the purpose of `async/await` in JavaScript?**
    - `async/await` is a syntactical feature that simplifies working with Promises. It allows writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous-looking style.

11. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` for variable declaration?**
    - `let` allows you to declare block-scoped variables that can be reassigned.
    - `const` allows you to declare block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned.
    - `var` allows you to declare function-scoped variables that can be reassigned.

12. **What are Arrow Functions?**
    - Arrow Functions are a shorthand syntax for writing concise function expressions. They retain the `this` context of their enclosing scope.

13. **Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.**
    - In prototypal inheritance, objects can inherit properties and methods from their prototype. It's a mechanism used to achieve inheritance in JavaScript.

14. **What is the spread operator in JavaScript?**
    - The spread operator (`...`) allows you to expand iterable objects (arrays, strings, etc.) into individual elements.

15. **How does event delegation work in JavaScript?**
    - Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor element instead of attaching multiple listeners to individual child elements. It helps improve performance and handle dynamic elements.

16. **What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?**
    - CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict cross-origin requests made by web pages.

17. **How can you handle errors in JavaScript?**
    - Errors can be handled using `try-catch` blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

18. **What are some new features in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)?**
    - Some new features in ES6 include `let` and `const`, arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, and more.

19. **How can you avoid callback hell (nested callbacks)?**
    - Callback hell can be avoided by using Promises, `async/await`, or modularizing code with functions.

20. **What are modules in JavaScript?**
    - Modules allow you to split code into separate files and import/export functionality between them, promoting code organization and reusability.

Remember, understanding the concepts behind these answers is crucial. Practicing coding examples related to these questions will help reinforce your knowledge and prepare you for your interview. Good luck!
